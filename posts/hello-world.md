# Hello World

Welcome to my personal site!

I'm **Chaeun Lee**, a researcher and engineer working at the intersection of AI, hardware-aware optimization, and efficient model design.

## What I Work On

My research spans several areas:

- **AI Simulation** -- building neural network-based simulators for analog circuit systems, and more recently, synthetic data generation with diffusion models
- **Large-scale Models** -- LLM quantization, acceleration, and serving
- **Lightweight & Efficient Models** -- quantization toolkits, NPU kernel optimization, and hardware-software co-design

## About This Site

I'll be sharing thoughts on research, engineering, and topics I find interesting. Stay tuned!
